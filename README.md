## How It Works

This library provides a unified way to translate requests and responses between different Large Language Model (LLM) providers. It allows developers to integrate with one interface (e.g., OpenAIâ€™s API) while actually calling another provider (e.g., Anthropic, Mistral, etc.), without rewriting application logic.

---

### The Challenge

Each LLM provider exposes its own request and response format:

- **OpenAI** expects `messages` arrays with `role/content` parts.
- **Anthropic** expects a different structure, with `system` and `user/assistant` segments.
- **Mistral** and others have yet more variations.

If you want to connect a tool that only understands **one interface** (e.g., OpenAI) to a **different backend** (e.g., Anthropic), you would normally need to write a direct conversion for every pair.

This leads to a **Cartesian product problem**:

- For _N_ providers, youâ€™d need _N Ã— (N-1)_ conversions.

---

### The Solution: Intermittent Format

Instead of converting directly between every provider pair, this library introduces a **standard intermittent format**.

The process works in two steps:

1. **Normalize â†’** Convert provider-specific request into the intermittent format.
2. **Transform â†’** Convert intermittent format into the target providerâ€™s request.

The same applies to responses:

1. Normalize response â†’ Intermittent format.
2. Transform intermittent format â†’ Desired interface (e.g., OpenAI-style).

With this approach, the number of conversions drops from _N Ã— (N-1)_ to just _2 Ã— N_ (one in and one out per provider).

### Quick Start

```kotlin
// Add dependencies
dependencies {
    implementation("com.fatihcure.kolo:providers:1.4.0")
    implementation("com.fatihcure.kolo:normalizers:1.4.0")
    implementation("com.fatihcure.kolo:transformers:1.4.0")
}

// Basic usage
val provider = KoloProvider()
val kolo = provider.createKolo<OpenAIRequest, AnthropicRequest>()
val converted = kolo.convertRequest(openAIRequest)
```

---

### Key Features

- **Unified interface** across providers.
- **Reduced complexity** via intermittent format.
- **Supports request & response conversion** (including errors, metadata).
- **Streaming-compatible** for real-time use cases.
- **Extensible**: add new providers by defining just two mappings (to/from intermittent format).
